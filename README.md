#Team:- HACTO-MISER


#INTRODUCTION

Girls have an equal hand in nations progress, ensuring the entire wellbeing of a country. We are here to create RURAL WOMEN EMPLOYMENT making them persistent in creating fields.
In rural areas, agriculture is one of the major occupations for a household and the only way to generate income. So, if women get trained in some jobs like stitching, pottery, handicrafts, pickle making etc. it can generate extra income for the family.  Also, an engaged women workforce benefit everyone. It also enhances the effectiveness of poverty reduction and food security initiatives. It will promote gender equality as well.

#WORKING

The scheme proposes different mechanisms for the benefits of women. Under this plan Aanganwadi at different locations will be connected to promote this scheme. Retailers, consumers and companies will be meeting on a common platform without any intermediator to earn maximum profit. The platform we prepared is a website where people can Register or Sign in themselves in different domains. There are three options available on how you want to join, as a company or an individual or as a learner. As a learner you would get different links to videos that would help u to work better on your skills day by day. Mobile vans and different Common centres are be developed for learning for those without any devices.  As a company you would be able to buy different products directly from the people who manufacturer them. As an individual you can put a picture of the products you prepare on the website. If someone is lacking the device, he/ she can visit the nearest skill centre or Aanganwadi to submit the product and get their ID. Further there is a product section on the home page which displays all the pictures of products that are available for buying. In that way the buyer and the seller meet on a common platform to work. Below on the website we have a donation section for People to donate for something beneficial to society.

#COMMUNITY PROFIT

This projects not only gives employment to the women but also enhances the interaction between them, which in turn increases the confidence in them. In this project ,women of nearby villages are able to form a community on the basis of products they are best in. For example, there are group of women selling pots and another group of women making baskets, chairs and so on. After becoming the part of the interested family there will be virtual group where there will be interaction among ladies, guidelines will be provided to the new member, videos will be there to make people learn about the product. So, it addresses group profit. Earlier only one woman was getting the profit but now there will be a group profit. Along with the profit, the efficiency of work is enhanced.

#CONCLUSION

Since there is a bunch of people working together, the development time of the products will be faster and not only this buyer will have multiple varieties of a single product which will make their shopping amazing. There are several advantages like unemployment reduction, enhanced confidence among women, awareness among villagers, no commission between buyer and seller
